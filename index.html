                <p>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of
                    text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it
                    part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns
                    of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This
                    module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need
                    to know to understand HTML.</p>

                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the
                    web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML
                    consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of
                    content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a
                    hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the
                    following line of text:</p>
                <code>My cat is very grumpy
                </code>
                <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                    a paragraph (< p>) element:
                </p>
                <code>< p >My cat is very grumpy< / p >
                </code>

            <article>
                <p>The anatomy of our element is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p
                        for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the
                        element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph
                        text.</li>
                    <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the
                        paragraph text.</li>
                    <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a
                        forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a
                        closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>

            <header>Block versus inline elements</header>
            <article>
                <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline
                    elements.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line
                        following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also
                        appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For
                        example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or
                        footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be
                        nested inside another block-level element.</li>
                    <li>Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the
                        document's content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not
                        cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an (< a>
                            ) element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as (< em>) or (< strong>) create emphasis.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Consider the following example:
                </p>
                <code>< em >first < / em >< em > second < / em > < em > third < / em >
                    < p > fourth < / p > <p > fifth < / p > < p > sixth < / p ></code>

            <article>
                <p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements
                    consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. For
                    example, the <img> element embeds an image file onto a page:
                </p>
                <code>< img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" ></code>

            <article>
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this
                    example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style
                    information.</p>
                <p>An attribute should have:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the
                        attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
                    <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                    <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.
                    </li>

        <section class="main-section" id="boolean_attributes">

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable. These are
                    called Boolean attributes. Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same
                    as the attribute name. For example, consider the disabled attribute, which you can assign to form
                    input elements. (You use this to disable the form input elements so the user can't make entries. The
                    disabled elements typically have a grayed-out appearance.) For example:</p>
                <code>< input type="text" disabled="disabled" >
                </code>
                <p>As shorthand, it is acceptable to write this as follows:</p>
                <code> < ! -- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box -- >
                    < input type = "text" disabled >
                    
                    < ! -- text input is allowed, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute -- > < input type = "text" > 
                </code>
